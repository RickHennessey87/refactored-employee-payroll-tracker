# refactored-employee-payroll-tracker

# Description

This application enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. The payroll manager can click the "Add Employees" button and enter payroll data through several prompts. After adding an employee's data, the app asks if they would like to add another, and they can choose to continue to add more employees or cancel. When they continue, the same series of prompts will be displayed. When they cancel, the application displays the employee's data on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data, including the average salary and a random drawing winner. In this project, I learned how to write efficient and executable javaScript functions using while loops, for loops, conditionals, and various variables and primitives.
